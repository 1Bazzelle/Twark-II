This is Twark, the prototype for the movement of a game, which I sadly didn't have the time for continuing.
The 2D Assets were not made by me, but by a friend of mine.

The most notable feature here are probably the Spring Physics.
The game will only let you jump, when you "charge" it, by crouching.

Controls:
A + D: accelerate horizontally
Shift: Crouch down
Space: Jump, when in a crouched state
